## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can predict the gender of Dollar Tree customers based on various features such as age, country, product category, quantity, and revenue.


## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python 3.x along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


## Usage

After installing the required libraries, you can run the project by executing the main Python script. Make sure to replace main.py with the actual name of your Python script

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about Dollar Tree customers, including their age, country, product category, quantity, revenue, and gender (target variable). The data is stored in a CSV file named dollar_tree_data.csv.

## Preprocessing

Before training the model, the data undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Training

The machine learning model is trained using various algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest. Hyperparameters are tuned using techniques like grid search or random search.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations such as confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to assess the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Results

The results of the model evaluation are presented, including visualizations and key findings regarding the model's predictive capabilities and areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a machine learning model for customer gender prediction using the Dollar Tree dataset. Future work may involve exploring additional features, optimizing model performance, and deploying the model in real-world applications.
