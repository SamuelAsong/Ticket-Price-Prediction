## Introduction
The Titanic Case Study analyzes survival patterns among passengers and builds a predictive model for ticket prices based on passenger attributes.
## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries:
-	pandas
-	scikit-learn
-	matplotlib
-	seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn 
## Usage
After installing the required libraries, run the main Python script to execute the project.
## Data
The dataset titanic.csv contains passenger information such as survival status, ticket class, sex, age, family relations, fare, cabin, and embarkation port.

## Preprocessing
Before model training, the data undergoes preprocessing steps like handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA includes visualizations and analyses of survival rates based on factors like sex, passenger class, and age distribution.

## Model Building
The project builds regression models to predict ticket prices and classification models to analyze survival factors.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with visualizations like confusion matrices and classification reports.

## Conclusion
The Titanic Case Study provides insights into survival factors and ticket price prediction, highlighting the importance of data analysis in historical events.
